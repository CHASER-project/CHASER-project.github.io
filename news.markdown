Today, all parties of the project came together for the second in-person meeting since the project started last year. The meeting was kindly hosted by Professor Adriano Moreira at his home institution, the University of Minho in Portugal. On the agenda were status updates on the groups' work on synthetic CSI datasets as well as real-world CSI data acquisition. Additionally, the participants presented recent developments in distributed and online channel charting and discussed further scenarios that could benefit from channel charting as a service.
